# Data-Organization-in-C
CS 241 Projects - Spring 2018

## Course Description
CS-241 is an introduction to the C Programming language, an introduction to using a command-line interface in the Linux operating system, and an introduction to machine level data organization and memory allocation. Students taking this course should already be familiar with basic concepts of computer programming such as variables, conditional control flow and loops. Developing mastery of these fundamental concepts is one of the goals of CS-241. Students in CS-241 author many C programs. Some lab assignments will be short and relatively simple. Others will be more interesting and touch on a wide range of computer applications including encryption, numerical analysis, databases, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms and games.
